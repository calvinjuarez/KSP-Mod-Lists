# KSP Mod Lists
This repository is just lists of links to mods for [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ "Kerbal Space Program") (KSP) that I like or want to try out, organized (very roughly) by the severity of their effects on gameplay and stock compatibility.  Not all mods have been checked for compatibility with current versions of KSP.


## Class 1 – _Ambiance_
These mods improve the general atmosphere or ambiance of the game without damaging compatibility.  That is, a game will work pretty much the same with or without the mod installed.

## Class 2 – _Trivial Parts_
These mods add parts, but don't generally add new mechanics.  The parts can often easily be removed from crafts to make them stock-compatible.

* NEBULA EVA Handrails
  - [Kerbal Stuff Page](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/353/NEBULA%20EVA%20handrails%20pack. "NEBULA EVA Handrails on Kerbal Stuff")

* [Surface Lights](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57778-1-0-Surface-Mounted-Stock-Alike-Lights-for-Self-Illumination "KSP Forum Thread")


## Class 3 – _Tools_
These are gameplay tools.  Their functions vary widely, so they also affect the game in lots of different ways.

## Class 4 – _Integral Mods_
These mods add whole new mechanics or tech systems, or parts that tend to become integral to crafts, making them difficult to remove from crafts without breaking them.  These mods become a part of how you play the game in a save, so removing is normally prohibitively difficult.

### _Tech_
These add tech, and usually add or change parts for that tech.

* Remote Tech
  - [Online Manual](https://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/ "Remote Tech Main Site")
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech "Remote Tech source on GitHub")
  - [KSP Forum Thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-1-0-4-RemoteTech-v1-6-7-2015-06-25 "Remote Tech KSP Forum Thread")
* SCANsat
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/S-C-A-N/SCANsat "SCANsat source on GitHub")
  - [Kerbal Stuff Page](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/249/SCANsat "SCANsat on Kerbal Stuff")

### _Integral Parts & Parts Packs_
These add large numbers of parts and/or parts that easily become integral to a craft, making that craft difficult to make stock-compatible.

* B9 Aerospace (KSP 0.90)
  - [Kerbal Stuff Page](http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/mod/132/B9%20Aerospace%20Pack "B9 Aerospace on Kerbal Stuff")
  - [KSP Forum Thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92630-0-90-B9-Aerospace-Release-5-2-8-(updated-30-12-14) "B9 Aerospace KSP Forum Thread")
* KW Rocketry (KSP 1.0.2)
  - [Kerbal Stuff Page](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/67/KW%20Rocketry "KW Rocketry on Kerbal Stuff")
  - [KSP Forum Thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51037-1-02-KW-Rocketry-v2-7-Available-1-02-Compatibility!-16-05-2015 "KW Rocketry KSP Forum Thread")


## Class 5 – _Game Changers_
These mods overhaul whole features, or in some cases, the whole game.  Air- or spacecraft built with them may not work the same way in stock.  The changes they introduce often make the gameplay substantially different to stock.

### _Community Bug Fixes_
These focus only on fixing bugs in the stock game, so save-breaking is minimal and gameplay is largely unaffected.

* [Stock Bug Fix Modules](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-4-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-(Release-v1-0-4b-2-1-Aug-15) "KSP Forum Thread")

### _Feature Overhauls_
These tend to add more realism to existing features.  Because they replace stock behavior, the saves created with them tend to be mostly incompatible with the stock game.

* Ferram Aerospace Research (FAR)
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research "Ferram Aerospace Research Source on GitHub")
  - [Kerbal Stuff Page](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/52/Ferram%20Aerospace%20Research "Ferram Aerospace Research on Kerbal Stuff")

### _Game Overhauls_
These are mods that change so much that they may feel like you're playing an entirely different game.

* [KSP Interstellar (KSP 0.25)](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-25-KSP-Interstellar-(Magnetic-Nozzles-ISRU-Revamp)-Version-0-13 "KSP Forum Thread")


## Class 6 – _Dependencies_
These mods often don't provide much visible functionality on their own, but are frequently dependencies for other mods.  Because of this, they may or may not introduce save-breaking changes themselves, but the mods that depend on them usually do.

* [Module Manager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-0-x-Module-Manager-2-6-7-(August-4th)-With-more-SHA256 "KSP Forum Thread")
* [Raster Prop Monitor](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117471-1-0-RasterPropMonitor-still-putting-the-A-in-IVA "KSP Forum Thread")
