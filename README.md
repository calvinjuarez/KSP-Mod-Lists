# KSP Mod Lists
This repository is just lists of links to KSP mods I like or want to try out, organized (very roughly) by the severity of their effects on gameplay and stock compatibility.


## Class 1 – *Ambiance*
These mods improve the general atmosphere or ambiance of the game without damaging compatibility.  That is, a game will work pretty much the same with or without the mod installed.

* [Stock Clamshell Fairings](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124031-1-0-4-Stock-Clamshell-Fairings-(June-1) "KSP Forum Thread")


## Class 2 – *Trivial Parts*
These mods add parts, but don't generally add new mechanics.  They may also tweak existing parts.  The parts can easily be removed from crafts to make them stock-compatible.

* [Surface Lights](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57778-1-0-Surface-Mounted-Stock-Alike-Lights-for-Self-Illumination "KSP Forum Thread")
* [EVA Handrails](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100531-0-25-NEBULA-space-engineering-EVA-handrails-pack "KSP Forum Thread")


## Class 3 – *Tools*
These are gameplay tools.  Their functions vary widely, so they also affect the game in lots of different ways.

* [Kerbal Engineer Redux](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-4-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-18-0 "KSP Forum Thread")
* [TweakScale](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80234-0-90-TweakScale-Rescale-Everything!-(v1-50-2014-12-24-10-40-UTC) "KSP Forum Thread")


## Class 4 – *Integral Mods*
These mods add whole new mechanics or tech systems, or parts that tend to become integral to crafts, making them difficult to remove from crafts without breaking them.  These mods become a part of how you play the game in a save, so removing is normally prohibitively difficult.

### *Tech*
These add tech, and usually add or change parts for that tech.

* [SCANsat](https://github.com/S-C-A-N/SCANsat "GitHub Repository")

### *Integral Parts & Parts Packs*
These add large numbers of parts and/or parts that easily become integral to a craft, making that craft difficult to make stock-compatible.

* [B9 Aerospace](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92630-0-90-B9-Aerospace-Release-5-2-8-(updated-30-12-14) "KSP Forum Thread")


## Class 5 – *Game Changers*
These mods overhaul whole features, or in some cases, the whole game.  Air- or spacecraft built with them may not work the same way in stock.  The changes they introduce often make the gameplay substantially different to stock.

### *Features*
* Ferram Aerospace Research (FAR)
  - [Kerbal Stuff Page](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/52/Ferram%20Aerospace%20Research "Ferram Aerospace Research on Kerbal Stuff")
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research "Ferram Aerospace Research on GitHub")

### *Game Overhauls*
* [KSP Interstellar](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-25-KSP-Interstellar-(Magnetic-Nozzles-ISRU-Revamp)-Version-0-13 "KSP Forum Thread")


## Class 6 – *Dependencies*
These mods often don't provide much visible functionality on their own, but are frequently dependencies for other mods.  Because of this, they may or may not introduce save-breaking changes themselves, but the mods that depend on them usually do.

* [Module Manager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-0-x-Module-Manager-2-6-7-(August-4th)-With-more-SHA256 "KSP Forum Thread")
* [Raster Prop Monitor](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117471-1-0-RasterPropMonitor-still-putting-the-A-in-IVA "KSP Forum Thread")
